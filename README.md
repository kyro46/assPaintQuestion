# ILIAS 4.4 paint question #

### Questiontype that allows drawing on a backgroundimage or a canvas ###

This plugin will add a questiontype, that allows:
* drawing on a canvas
* adding a backgroundimage and drawing on it
* changing the color
* changing the pensize
* undo/redo/delete painted lines

### Usage ###

Install the plugin (e.g. with the provided .ZIP) to
* Customizing/global/plugins/Modules/TestQuestionPool/Questions

and activate it in the ILIAS-Admin-GUI.

### Known Issues ###

* PDF-generation for the "Test Archive File" does not support canvas, so the plain HTML/Base64-String is in the PDF.
